# bulletHell
This is a little touhou style bullet hell that takes an audio file to generate the attack paterns of the enemy and background animations.
Requires pygame, tkinter, and librosa. 
bulletHellWithMenus.py is the 'finished' game, I've only had it running on linux mint despite trying quite a bit on windows. Something to do with librosa. Wasted too much time trying to fix that and gave up.
